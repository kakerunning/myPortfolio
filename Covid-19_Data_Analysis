# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## Overview
In this project, I analyzed COVID-19 data to gain insights into the impact and progress of the pandemic. The data was sourced from Our World in Data.

## Dataset
The resauce of the dataset is [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
The dataset includes global data on COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations. I created two CSV files from this dataset for my analysis.

[COvidVacctinations](https://github.com/kakerunning/myPortfolio/blob/main/CovidVactinations.zip)
## Tools and Technologies
I used [SQL](https://github.com/kakerunning/myPortfolio/blob/main/covid_portfolio_project.sql) for data exploration and abstraction. The visualizations were created using Tableau.

## Process
1. **Data Extraction**: Extracted data from Our World in Data and created two CSV files: one for COVID-19 deaths and another for COVID-19 vaccinations.
2. **Data Exploration**: Explored and abstracted some of the data using SQL.
3. **Data Visualization**: Visualized the data in Tableau to gain insights into the impact and progress of the pandemic.

## Visualizations
You can view the Tableau visualization [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kakeru.ogasawara/viz/covid19_17115493964880/Dashboard1).

## Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the progress of vaccinations. The visualizations created in Tableau effectively communicate these insights.
