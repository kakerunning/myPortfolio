## Projects

### COVID-19 Data Analysis
In this project, I analyzed COVID-19 data from Our World in Data. I created two CSV files from the dataset: one for COVID-19 deaths and another for COVID-19 vaccinations. I then explored and abstracted some of the data using SQL. Finally, I visualized the data in Tableau to gain insights into the impact and progress of the pandemic. You can view the Tableau visualization here.https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kakeru.ogasawara/viz/covid19_17115493964880/Dashboard1

### Economic Data Analysis with FRED API
In this project, I used the FRED API to extract economic data and performed an analysis using pandas in a Jupyter notebook. The main focus of the analysis was on the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate across different states. I explored the data, performed data cleaning and manipulation, and finally visualized the results to gain insights.
