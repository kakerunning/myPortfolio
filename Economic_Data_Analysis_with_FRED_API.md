# Economic Data Analysis with FRED API

## Overview
In this project, I used the FRED API to extract economic data and performed an analysis using pandas in a Jupyter notebook. The main focus of the analysis was on the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate across different states.

## Dataset
The dataset includes various economic indicators from the FRED API.[FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)

## Tools and Technologies
I used pandas for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis. The visualizations were created using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Process
1. **Data Extraction**: Extracted data from the FRED API.
2. **Data Cleaning and Manipulation**: Cleaned and manipulated the data using pandas.
3. **Data Analysis**: Analyzed the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate across different states.
4. **Data Visualization**: Visualized the results using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Results

The S&P 500 has experienced a positive trend over the past 10 years (2015-2024). This signifies a generally bullish market with increasing index value.

 - States with the Highest Unemployment Rates in May 2020: Nevada (25%), Hawaii (23.9%), Rhode Island (22.8%)
 - States with the Lowest Unemployment Rates in May 2020: South Dakota (4.1%), Nebraska (4.2%), Vermont (4.4%)
 - We can also see that several states have unemployment rates between 10% and 15%, including California, Illinois, and New Jersey.
